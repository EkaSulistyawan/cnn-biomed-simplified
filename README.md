# cnn-biomed-simplified
The objective of this repo is to simplify Sedana Yoga's works on detecting Arteri Radial using CNN. I'm trying to deliver the knowledge in a clear and structured notebook. I may understand better by re-build the pipeline in a form of well-story-told Jupyter Notebook. Make sure you check his works at this [link](https://github.com/SedanaYoga/unetradar) for further details!
